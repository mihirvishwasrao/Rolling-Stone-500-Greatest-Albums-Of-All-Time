    <h2>About the visualization</h2>
    <p>The following visualization displays each album as a colored rectangle on a 2D canvas, with the x-axis
      corresponding to the release year of the album and the y-axis corresponding to its ranking on the list. The color
      of each rectangle is determined by the genre of the album. The legend allows users to filter albums by genre. Upon
      hovering the cursor over a rectangle, details such as Album name, Artist name, and its Ranking are displayed. The
      visualization provides an interactive exploration of the albums, offering insights into their distribution across
      genres, release years, and rankings, allowing the users to explore the relationship between them in a visually
      appealing manner.</p>
